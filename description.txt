# CHESS EXTREME

## Description

Chess Extreme is a game that should be played by those that are bored of classical chess or are willing to try something new, exciting, and fabuluous. Be Ready to have your mind blown! On a more serious note, the game features three main modes:-
- SinglePlayer (Easy against an AI) - extremely benefitial to become better and understand the game.
- MultiPlayer (Against a friend) - has a variety of modes alongside the extreme signature mode.
- Tutorial - introduces the player to the basic mechanics of the game alongside some advanced openings.

Furthermore, these gamemodes are enjoyable from chess.py and achessPieces.py. If you ignore them and open the file named "socket," you can play chess extreme's signature mode with anyone on the same network.

## Needed Libraries

Here are the needed libraries, which can be easily installed using pip:-
- cmu_graphics
- socket

## How It Works

For the first part of the game, all you have to do is run chess.py. Make sure that the Pictures folder, achiessPieces.py and chess.py files have been downloaded and are organized in your files correctly.
For the second part of the game, you have to run server.py, then open 2 seperate command prompts. Type "cd PATH TO FILE" in the command prompts and then run "python player1.py" on one command prompt and "python player2.py" on the other.

## Credits

Any references or credits have already been mentioned in the code. The game logic and graphics were written by me without any extrenal help and for the socket, [techwithtim's](https://github.com/techwithtim) videos and tutorials played a huge role in helping me understand the basics.


### Enjoy!
